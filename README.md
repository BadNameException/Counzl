## Counzl
Counzl is a marketplace where you can buy validated information online, like the StackOverflow for whatever you wish to ask.

## Motivation
Our motivation behind this project is to learn more about the blockchain technology for the course IS-213 at the University of Agder. We wanted to create something meaningful, which at the same time allowed us to do this. We use sites like StackOverflow more or less daily but did not want to constrain us to a specific area.
